Warning: this repo is in very early development and not yet ready for use yet.

The goal of express is to simplify exploration of tabular, gene-level expression datasets 


## Installation

You can install the development version of express like so:

``` r
# install.packages('remotes')
remotes::install_github('selkamand/express')
```

## Quick Start

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(express)

path_example <- system.file("example.tsv" ,package = "express")
df_expression <- read_expression_table(path_example)


express_gene_distribution(
  data = df_expression, 
  genes = "TP53", 
  sample_metadata = df_sample_metadata, 
  colour_by = "Disease"
)

express_pathway_distribution(
  data = df_expression, 
  pathways = list("pathway_name" = c("gene1", "gene2", "gene3"))
  sample_metadata = df_sample_metadata, 
  colour_by = "Disease"
)


express_sample_relatedness(
  data = df_expression, 
  method = "TSNE",
  gene_selector = "most_variable",
  sample_metadata = df_sample_metadata, 
  colour_by = "Disease"
)
```
