## Installation

You can install the development version of express like so:

``` r
# install.packages('remotes')
remotes::install_github('selkamand/express')
```

## Quick Start

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(express)

path_example <- system.file("example.tsv" ,package = "express")
df_expression <- read_expression_table(path_example)
```
